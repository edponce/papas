PaPaSParser: INI-based Format
=============================


This section provides the specification for PaPaSParser, used in both
configuration files and task parameter descriptions. This specification
is an extension of the INI format and uses a combination of dictionaries
and lists.

* A PaPaSParser implementation consists of tasks (or sections), identified
  by a '[task]' (or '[section]') header, and followed by up to two levels
  of 'name/value' entries. That is, the first set of values can themselves
  be a pair of 'name/value' entries.

* '[task]' (or '[section]') should not contain any whitespace to its left,
  that is, it should start at the first column of a line.

* The delimiter for 'name/value' entries is the colon character (':').

* The first level of 'names' should not contain any whitespace to its left,
  that is, it should start at the first column of a line.

* Indentation, tabs or whitespace, is used to make a 'value' pertain to a
  particular 'name'.

* A 'name' can be specified using any alphanumeric character, [0-9a-zA-Z].

* Predefined 'names' are:
    * 'name' - string describing the task
    * 'environ' - dictionary of environment variables, 'names' are the actual
                  names of the environment variables.
                  They are set automaticatically, do not include in 'command'.
    * 'command' - string representing the command line to run
    * 'after' - list of tasks dependencies, prerequisites
    * 'infiles' - dictionary of input files, 'names' are arbitrary
    * 'outfiles' - dictionary of output files, 'names' are arbitrary

* A 'task' is identified by the mandatory 'name/value' pair: 'command'.
  A 'section' does not have the 'command' 'name/value' pair.

* Inter-task interpolation using '${...}' syntax is allowed using 'values'
  from both levels of entries, '${name}' and '${name:value}'.

* Intra-task interpolation using '${...}' syntax is allowed using 'values'
  from both levels of entries, '${task:name}' and '${task:name:value}'.

* A single-line comment is a line that starts with a hash sign, '#'.


Example
=======

# This example describes two tasks, one called 'hello' that executes the
# program 'helloWorld.py' twice due to interpolation of values given in
# 'xparam'. The second task is called 'hello2' and has the same execution
# model as task 'hello'. Note that intra-task and inter-task interpolation
# are used to specify 'values' and it executes after task 'hello'.

[hello]
name: Hello world example
program: examples/helloWorld/helloWorld.py
cmdargs:
    xparam:
        10
        30
command: ${program} --xparam ${cmdargs:xparam}


[hello2]
name: Hello world example 2
program: ${hello:program}
cmdargs:
    xparam: ${hello:cmdargs:xparam}
command: ${program} --xparam ${cmdargs:xparam}
after:
    hello


PaPaSParser: YAML Format (recommended)
======================================

This section provides the specification for PaPaSParser, used in both
configuration files and task parameter descriptions. This specification
follows the YAML format which is based on dictionaries and lists.

* This specification gets YAML ideas from Ansible:
  http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/YAMLSyntax.html

* A PaPaSParser implementation consists of tasks (or sections), identified
  by a dictionary with the 'task' (or 'section') as the only key, and followed
  by up to two levels of 'name/value' entries. That is, the first set of
  values can themselves be a pair of 'name/value' entries.

* The delimiter for 'name/value' entries is the colon character (':').

* Indentation, tabs or whitespace, is used to make a 'value' pertain to a
  particular 'name'.

* A 'name' can be specified using any alphanumeric character, [0-9a-zA-Z].

* Predefined 'names' are:
    * 'name' - string describing the task
    * 'environ' - dictionary of environment variables, 'names' are the actual
                  names of the environment variables.
                  They are set automaticatically, do not include in 'command'.
    * 'command' - string representing the command line to run
    * 'after' - list of tasks dependencies, prerequisites
    * 'infiles' - dictionary of input files, 'names' are arbitrary
    * 'outfiles' - dictionary of output files, 'names' are arbitrary

* A 'task' is identified by the mandatory 'name/value' pair: 'command'.
  A 'section' does not have the 'command' 'name/value' pair.

* Inter-task interpolation using '${...}' syntax is allowed using 'values'
  from both levels of entries, '${name}' and '${name:value}'.

* Intra-task interpolation using '${...}' syntax is allowed using 'values'
  from both levels of entries, '${task:name}' and '${task:name:value}'.

* A single-line comment is a line that starts with a hash sign, '#'.


Example
=======

hello:
    name: Hello world example
    program: example/helloWorld/helloWorld.py
    cmdargs:
        xparam:
            - 10
            - 30
    command: ${program} --xparam ${cmdargs:xparam}


hello2:
    name: Hello world example 2
    program: ${hello:program}
    cmdargs:
        xparam: ${hello:cmdargs:xparam}
    environ:
        OMP_NUM_THREADS:
            - 2
            - 4
            - 8
    command: ${program} --xparam ${cmdargs:xparam}
    after:
        - hello


PaPaSParser: JSON Format
========================

This section provides the specification for PaPaSParser, used in both
configuration files and task parameter descriptions. This specification
follows the JSON format which is based on dictionaries and lists.

* A PaPaSParser implementation consists of tasks (or sections), identified
  by a dictionary with the 'task' (or 'section') as the only key, and followed
  by up to two levels of 'name/value' entries. That is, the first set of
  values can themselves be a pair of 'name/value' entries.

* The delimiter for 'name/value' entries is the colon character (':').

* A 'name' can be specified using any alphanumeric character, [0-9a-zA-Z].

* Predefined 'names' are:
    * 'name' - string describing the task
    * 'environ' - dictionary of environment variables, 'names' are the actual
                  names of the environment variables.
                  They are set automaticatically, do not include in 'command'.
    * 'command' - string representing the command line to run
    * 'after' - list of tasks dependencies, prerequisites
    * 'infiles' - dictionary of input files, 'names' are arbitrary
    * 'outfiles' - dictionary of output files, 'names' are arbitrary

* A 'task' is identified by the mandatory 'name/value' pair: 'command'.
  A 'section' does not have the 'command' 'name/value' pair.

* Inter-task interpolation using '${...}' syntax is allowed using 'values'
  from both levels of entries, '${name}' and '${name:value}'.

* Intra-task interpolation using '${...}' syntax is allowed using 'values'
  from both levels of entries, '${task:name}' and '${task:name:value}'.

* Comments are not allowed, use a dummy 'name/value' pair.
